INSERT INTO Posts (Title, Content, Created, Updated, Visible) VALUES ('About this Blog', 'Welcome to the blog for addison.im! This blog will be used to document my side projects and share anything interesting I find.  The backend of the blog was built using <a href="http://laravel.com" target="_blank">Laravel 4</a>, a popular PHP framework. The framework uses a MVC design pattern which I am starting to feel comfortable with. In the past I have worked with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> and found the MVC structure a bit confusing at first, but after reading the <a href="https://leanpub.com/laravel4cookbook" target="_blank">Laravel 4 Cookbook</a> and some other online tutorials I think I have it figured out. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nUsing Laravel I was able to make this simple blog and CMS. New posts are created through the admin dashboard, where comments are approved and posts are edited as well. I haven''t created a way, besides a database seed class, for creating new users since I will be the only one making posts. A demo of the admin dashboard can be seen <a href="http://addison.im/blog/demo/dashboard.php" target="_blank">here</a>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nI wanted to keep Laravel and the blog on the /blog/ directory since I plan on hosting other projects on this domain so I ended up using RSS to link posts across the site (something I picked up from working with WordPress). An RSS feed is generated with <a href="https://github.com/jbenzshawel/addison.im.blog/blob/master/feed/index.php" target="_blank">some PHP</a> at <a href="http://addison.im/blog/feed/" target="_blank">addison.im/blog/feed/</a> and then read in the XML file, again with PHP, where ever I want to list the latest posts (this is how posts are listed on the addison.im page).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nI ran into a problem of links to posts, similar to /blog/post/12/show/, being redirected to /post/12/show/ since the Laravel installation thinks it is configured at the root level. I decided to just write a <code>mod_rewrite</code> rule on the .htaccess file as seen below:\r\n<pre>\r\n<span style="color:#a4a4a4;"># redirect fix for posts from outside links</span>\r\n<span style="color:#26368b;">RewriteEngine</span> On\r\n<span style="color:#26368b;">RewriteRule</span> ^post/(.*)$  /blog/public/post/$1  [R=301,NE,L] \r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n<p style="width:80%;">The rewrite rule is pretty self explanatory. The <code>(.*)</code> in combination with <code>$1</code> takes everything past /post/ in the original URL and places it where the <code>$1</code> is, <code>R=301</code> means that the address bar will reflect the change in URL, and the <code>NE</code> ensures that the request is not escaped. The <code>L</code> flag means that if the rule matches, no further rules will be processed.</p>\r\n<p style="width:80%;">To look at the code for this blog check out the <a href="https://github.com/jbenzshawel/addison.im.blog" target="_blank">github repo here</a>.

Since I had a few weeks off I thought this would be a good project. I decided the end goal would be to recreate reddit in the RoR MVC framework. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nLearning the basics of ruby wasn''t too hard but about half way through <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl I decided I was not learning much and had created the example apps without really understanding MVC. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSince I still wanted to finish the project, and also was looking for a new project to work on, I decided to build the back end of the site in PHP/MySQL instead of Ruby on Rails/SQLite. Having not really understood the MVC framework at the time I did not follow any design pattern besides trying to keep the site <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">RESTful</a>. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nI plan on going back and reworking the structure of the site to follow a MVC design pattern in the future.

The goal of the post was to see what you could create in under 1 KB of data. I came up with the idea of making a Reddit RSS reader (unoriginal idea, I know). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After I finished a version to host I realized that I cannot use any PHP in the site, just JS/HTML. I plan on making a version in JS in the future but right now it is in either PHP/XSL or just PHP. The latest version is being hosted on my site at <a href="http://addison.im/oneK/" target="_blank">addison.im/oneK/</a> and I also have <a href="http://reddit.onekb.net/" target="_blank">reddit.onekb.net/</a> for another couple of hours. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once on the site you can search by subreddit but just adding it on like it is another directory. For example to list only posts in <code>/r/webdev/</code> you would write <code>/oneK/webdev/</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site pulls in content from the RSS feed at <a href="http://reddit.com/.rss" target="_blank">http://reddit.com/.rss</a> using a combination of PHP and XSLT (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT" target="_blank">Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations</a>). The website I help develop at work uses RSS feeds to pass content around the site since WordPress automatically generates them for posts. At work today for some reason RSS feeds were not working inside of the building''s network. When I noticed my site wasn''t working I thought there was an issue with the XML to XSLT transformation so I rewrote the site to only use PHP (I actually prefer using just PHP to parse XML feeds but I thought using XSLT would be more concise, which I was wrong about), but the error persisted. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the <a href="http://github.com/jbenzshawel/oneK/" target="_blank">github repo</a> for the site. The live version is way over the 1,000 Byte limit since I chose to add the subreddit feature. I plan on having a new version, under 1 KB in just PHP/CSS  up soon as well as adding some more styles to the current version like a header/menu with subreddits. </p>', '2014-04-24 06:21:15', '2014-04-24 06:21:15', 1);

In my last few weeks of work at my previous position I was in charge of migrating the organization’s WP Multisite into a sandbox environment in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>. For performance and ease of maintenance we decided to use an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank">EC2 instance</a> to run the WordPress site with the database set up in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">RDS</a>.

The customer service is helpful, the amount of control over the servers is awesome, and the new site is fast. Page load times went from eight seconds (I know way too slow) to three seconds. Most of this is due to using <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">Require.js</a> and asynchronus calls with JS to parse RSS feeds, however I think moving from GoDaddy helped.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2014-07-08 08:56:14', '2016-03-10 03:07:39', 1);
